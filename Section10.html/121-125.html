 121. Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale

 - What is CloudFormation?
    CloudFormation is going to be used when we have infrastructure as code, when we need to repeat an arhitecture in different environments, different regions, or even different AWS accounts
    - CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
    EX: within a CloudFormation template, you say"
        I want a security group
        I want two EC2 instances using this security group
        I want an S3 bucket
        I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
    then CLoudFormation creates those for you, in the RIGHT ORDER, with the EXACT CONFIGURATION that you specify

    Benefits: 
    - Infrastructure is as code (never create resources manually)
    - changes to infrastructure are reviewd through code reviews, which creates a safety net
    cost benefits:
    - each resource within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
    - you can easily estimate the cost of your resources using the CloudFormation template
    - Savings strategy: in some environemtn you can automate the deletion of templates at 5pm and recreate them at 8am safely, you don't have any resources during that time which leads to costs savings
    productivity: 
        - ability to destroy and recreate an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
        - automated generation of diamgrams for your templates
        - declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
    don't reinvent the wheel:
        - leverage existing templates on the web
        - leverage existing documentation
    support almost all AWS resources
        - you can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported

CloudFormaion + Application Composer
visualize a CloudFormation template using the Application Composer service
    EX: WordPress CloudFormation Stack

    125. AWS Cloud Developer Kit
        - define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language: Javascript/typescript, python, java, and .NET
        - then the code is compiled into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
        - you can delpoy infrastructure and application runtime code together (if they share the same languages)
            - great for Lambda functions
            - great for Docker containers in DCS/EKS
        - why use a familiar programming language?
            - can use type safety, constructs, to complete the project faster, to reuse some code, have for loops, etc.

111 - Docker
++++++

 Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
 - apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
- apps run the same regardless of where they're run
- scale containers up and down very quickly (in seconds)

Docker Images
- create docker images to run containers
- docker images are store in docker repositories
- repositories
    - public repo called Docker Hub
         - you can find the base images for many technologies or OS here
    - private
         - Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

Docker VS Virtual Machines

EC2 has infrastructure, host OS, hypervisor, and each ec2 instance has the application onto the guest OS, 

docker - infrastrucutre, host OS (ec2 instance), docker daemon, and many different containers running without needing their own guest OS = more lightweight, easy to run & scale

112 - ECS, Fargate & ECR Overview
++++++

- ECS
    - Elastic Container Service
    - used to launch docker containers on AWS
    - must create infrastructure in advance & maintain it (the EC2 instances)
    - AWS takes care of starting & stopping containers (smart enoguh to find WHICH ECS instance to place new containers)
    - has integrations iwth the Application Load Balancer

    - Fargate
        - used to launch Docker containers on AWS
        - do NOT provide infrastrucure (no EC2 instances to manage)
        - Serverless offering
        - AWS runs containers based on your needs - the CPU/RAM you require

    - ECR
        - Elastic Container Registry
        - used to store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate
        - a private Docker registry on AWS

114 - Lambda Overvew
++++++

- virtual servers in the cloud
- limited by RAM and CPU power we give it
- continuously running
- in order to scale, we need to add or remove servers over time (which can be slow or complicated, although it can be done using an auto scaling group, however)

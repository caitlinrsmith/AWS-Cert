111 - Docker
++++++

 Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
 - apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
- apps run the same regardless of where they're run
- scale containers up and down very quickly (in seconds)

Docker Images
- create docker images to run containers
- docker images are store in docker repositories
- repositories
    - public repo called Docker Hub
         - you can find the base images for many technologies or OS here
    - private
         - Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

Docker VS Virtual Machines

EC2 has infrastructure, host OS, hypervisor, and each ec2 instance has the application onto the guest OS, 

docker - infrastrucutre, host OS (ec2 instance), docker daemon, and many different containers running without needing their own guest OS = more lightweight, easy to run & scale

112 - ECS, Fargate & ECR Overview
++++++

- ECS
    - Elastic Container Service
    - used to launch docker containers on AWS
    - must create infrastructure in advance & maintain it (the EC2 instances)
    - AWS takes care of starting & stopping containers (smart enoguh to find WHICH ECS instance to place new containers)
    - has integrations iwth the Application Load Balancer

    - Fargate
        - used to launch Docker containers on AWS
        - do NOT provide infrastrucure (no EC2 instances to manage)
        - Serverless offering
        - AWS runs containers based on your needs - the CPU/RAM you require

    - ECR
        - Elastic Container Registry
        - used to store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate
        - a private Docker registry on AWS

113 - Serverless Meaning Overview

114 - Lambda Overvew
++++++

Amazon EC2 has"
    - virtual servers in the cloud
    - limited by RAM and CPU power we give it
    - continuously running
    - in order to scale, we need to add or remove servers over time (which can be slow or complicated, although it can be done using an auto scaling group, however)

Amazon Lambda has:
    - virtual functions (no servers to manage)
    - limited by time - intended for short executions
    - runs on-demand
    - scaling is automated

Benefits of AWS Lambda:

    -Easy Pricing
        - pay per request & compute time
        - free tier is very generous (1 million Lambda requests & 400k GBs of compute time)
         - pricing 
            - is based on calls and duration
            - is VERY cheap to run so makes Lambda VERY popular
    - integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
    - Event-Driven - functions get invoked by AWS when needed (a reactive service)
    - integrated with many programming languages
    - easy monitoring through AWS Cloud Watch (a monitoring solution in AWS)
    - Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM)
    - Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network quality
    - Language Support
        - Node.js(javascript), Python, Java, C#(.NET Core or PowerShell), Ruby, Custom Runtime API (community supported, ex: Rust or Golang)
    - can implement container images - Lambda Container Image
        - the container must implement the Lambda Runtime API
        - ECS/Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images (even tho Lambda offers SOME support for customized Docker images)

Very Common Use Case of LAmbda: 
    Serverless Thumbnail Creation
        - users upload img into an S3 bucket
        - the img upload triggers a Lambda Function to create a thumbnail
        - it will push the thumbnail back to the S3 bucket AND/OR push metadata about the img in to DynamoDB
        - all of this is completely event-driven and serverless (DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda you don't provision servers)
            - this means app will scale really well
    Serverless CRON Job
        - you can define a schedule to run a script
        - by default CRON jobs are run on Linux AMI (Linux machine)
        - CloudWatchEvents EventBridge is a serverless way to run CRON Jobs without provisiioning an EC2 instance

115 - Lambda Hands-on
    - deploy changes by clicking deploy
    - test (functions) with the test button
    - errorType: Exception is an error
    - CloudWatch Logs to understand where the error happened, run time, billed time, etc
    - Runtime Settings
    - you can see the file and function name that Lamba is told to invoke
    -  Permissions - a role was created by the Lambda Console to write to CloudWatch Logs to create logstreams, etc.

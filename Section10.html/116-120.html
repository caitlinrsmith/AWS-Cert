116.  Amazon API Gateway

 how to create a serverkess API = API Gatewat + Lambda

 - using Lambda to perform CRUD operations on data from DynamoDB but we want external clients to access our Lambda function. 
 - need to expose our Lambda function as an API through an API gateway, which gives the client a rest HTTP API to connect directly to my website

 client (comp) talks to the API gateway, which proxies requests to the Lambda function, which executes changes on the data in DynamoDB

 features
 - fully managed service for developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs
 - serverless and scalable
 - supports RESTful APIs and Websocket APIs
- suports security, user auth, API throttling, API keys, monitoring, etc

117. AWS Batch

- fully managed batch processing at any scale
- efficiently run 100,000s of computing jobs on AWS
- a "batch" job is a job with a set start time and end time
- Batch wil dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot instances as needed, this leads to
- cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure
- AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute/memory
- just submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
- batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS

Batch VS Lambda

    Lambda
    - time limit of 15 mins
    - can only access a few progmramming languages
    - limited temporary disk space
    - serverless

    Batch: 
    - no time limit
    - any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker image
    - rely on EBS/instance store for disk space (which can be a lot more than for Lambda functions)
    - NOT serverless - rely on EBS/instance store for disk space
    - relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)

118 . Amazon Lightsail
 on the exam: Why lightsail? for someone w no cloud experience, low and predictable pricing and don't have to configure many things = Lightsail

- Virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking all in one place
- low and predictable pricing
- Simpler alternative compared to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53, etc
- great fo rppl w little cloud experience!
- can setup notifications and monitoring of your Lightsail resources
- has high availability but no auto-scaling, limited AWS integrations

use cases: 
- simple web apps (has templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js, etc)
- Websites (Wordpress, Magento, Plesk, Joomla)
- Dev/Test environment

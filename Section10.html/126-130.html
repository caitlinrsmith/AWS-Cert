<!--    126. Beanstalk Overview
        - when we deploy a web app in AWS it usually follows a 3-tier architecture
            1) 
            users talk to a load balancer tha can be in multiple availability zones
            2) 
            the load balancer forwards traffic to multiple EC2 instances, managed by an autoscaling group
            3) 
            - EC2 instances store data in a database such as Amazon RDS
            - ElastiCache to store/retrieve session data + Cached data
        - we can easily reproduce this architecture manually or on AWS through CloudFormation, but a better way is to use 
        - Developer Problems on AWS
            - don't want to managing infrastructure
            - dont want to configure all the databases, load balancer, etc
            - just want to delpoy code & ensure project is scalable
        
        - most web apps have the same architecture -- ALB (load balancer) + ASG (auto scaling group)
        - all the develoeprs want is for their code to run! and possibly, consinstently run across different applications and environments
    
        Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS

        - Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        - it uses all the componenets we've seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc..
        - but it's all in one view that's easy to make sense of!
        - & we still have full control over the configuration of all the components
        - Elastic Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances
        - Elastic Beanstalk is a managed service
            - instance configuration/OS is handled by Beanstalk
            - deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk
            - load balancing * autoscaling by Beanstalk
            - Application health-monitoring & responsiveness by Beanstalk
            - just the application code is the responsibility of the developer

            - three architecture models:
                - single instance deployment = good for dev
                - LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
                - ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers etc.)
            
        Support for many platforms
            - Go, Java SE, Java with Tomcat, etc. more examples listed in the lecture
        
        Elastic Beanstalk - Health Monitoring
            - health agent pushes metrics to CloudWatch
            - Checks for app health, publushes health events

    127. Beanstalk Hands-ON

    128. AWS CodeDeploy
        - a way to deploy our application automatically
        - completely independent, doens't need to use Beanstalk or CloudFormation
        - if we have version 1 and want to deploy Version 2, CodeDeploy will find a way to do this for us automatically & from a single interface
        - CodeDeploy works with EC2 instances & On-premises Servers
        - HYBRID service - because it works with On-Premises & EC2 instances
        - Servers/Instances must be provisioned & configured ahead of time with the CodeDeploy agent
    
        129. CodeCommit - DEprecated 
            - assume there is a GitHub integration in place of CodeCommit

<!-- Introduction to SQL
by Simon Allardice -->

<!-- SQL is everywhere 
 - use SQL to work with databases, that is the only purpose
 
 database features:
 -scalable
 shareable
 secure
 no data integrity (makes sure the data has the right fields, info)

 Database Management Systems (DBMS):
 MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS, etc

 Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

- some systems are "NoSQL" databases such as MondoDB and Redis, but many DBMS uses SQL and even have SQL in their names

- entities are the "things/items" that belong in a database

- when creating a database, you need to think about whether any columns should allow the value pf "null" or not, for example a middle initial column or an address line 2 section

- primary keys
- primary keys have to contain unique values in that column
(2 primary keys can NOT be the same)

- we can use an existing column for data we deem should always be unique, sich as an email address, but we can also have the DBMS create unique primary key values fo rus automatically

PK, a key icon, or Primary key is a good way to label the primary key column

a one to many relationship example"

there is a customer qith a unique customer ID, and they have many different orders, so the one is the customer and their customer ID, and the many is their various orders in the orders table
